    > ⚠️ _WARNING:_ This image is deprecated and unsupported. Please switch to another image like [the official `gradle` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/gradle).

    A Java development image with Gradle installed.

    ## How to build

    The Docker image can be built using the following command

    ```{bash}
    docker build -t <your Docker Hub ID>/gradle .
    ```

    where the dot is the current folder, assuming you are running the docker command from the same folder of the Dockerfile.
    If you want a specific Gradle version, build the image with this command instead:

    ```{bash}
    docker build -t <your Docker Hub ID>/gradle --build-arg GRADLE_VERSION=<Gradle version> .
    ```
